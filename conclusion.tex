
\section{Conclusion}
There is a large ongoing competition on how to architecture massively parallel systems.
Nvidia's Pascal architecture represents a big step forward in the CPU-Accelerator approach.
The most relevant new features are the new GPU-to-GPU interconnect NVLink and how this enables a functional Unified Memory model.
Additionally, Nvidia's ability to influence CPU design in through the OpenPower Foundation, brings a new competition approach.
It will be interesting to see how the competition with Intel's Many Integrated Core Architecture develops.
